!!!MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER TOO!!!

This is a modified fork of "AllTheMons", originally created by EasySqueeze.
Due to the pack's creation, it is recommended to keep it overall private--only share and use it with people you trust. Do not use it on public multiplayer servers.

As for the fork's purpose, it is meant to add every Pokémon, and with high quality models. But at the end of the day, it's all about finding and catching new Pokémon--so what are you waiting for?
